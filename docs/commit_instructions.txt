All work should be implemented on "develop" branch.

When work is done we need to push our code to GitHub and merge with 'main' branch'.

### PUSH DEVELOP BRANCH TO GITHUB ###
git fetch
git commit -m "current work description"
git push origin develop

### MERGE DEVELOP BRANCH AND PUSH TO GITHUB"
git checkout main
git pull
git merge --no-ff develop
git push origin main
